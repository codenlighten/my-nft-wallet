Built on top of the Bitcoin-Computer/artwork application for creating and sharing tokens. You can create a new music token based on original musical creations and send it to a friend. The screen refreshes every few seconds to show the tokens owned by each user. Built using [Bitcoin|Computer](https://bitcoin-computer.gitbook.io/docs/). Thank you Clemens!
